    "## Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular one is Gradient Boosting.  Similar to AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting works by adding sequential predictors.  However, instead of adding **weights**, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the **residual errors** made by the previous predictor.    The hypothesis function of gradient boosting is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(x) = h_0(x) + \\alpha_1h_1(x) + \\cdots + \\alpha_sh_s(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they look similar, notice that no alpha is applied to the first predictor.  In addition, each alpha is the same, as opposed to voting power in AdaBoost.  Typically, similar to AdaBoost, decision trees are used for each $h_i(x)$ but are not limited to stump.  In practice, min_leaves are set to around 8 to 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since gradient boosting actually originate from additive linear regression, we shall first talk about **gradient boosting for regression**.  Also assume that we are using **regression trees** for our regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's look at the following equation where $h_0(x)$ is our first predictor and we would like to minimize the residual as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_0(x) + residual_0 = y $$\n",
    "$$ residual_0 =  y - h_0(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we would $y$ to be as close as $h_0(x)$ such that residual is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = h_0(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is that is it possible to add the second predictor $h_1(x)$ such that the residual is further reduced\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = h_0(x) + h_1(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_1(x) = y - h_0(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation informs us that if we can find a subsequent predictor that can best fit the \"residual\" (i.e. $y - h_0(x)$), then we can improve the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is this related to gradient descent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, firstly, here is our loss function for regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J = \\frac{1}{2}(y - h(x))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And here, we want to minimize $J$ by gradient of the loss function in respect to by adjusting $h_x$.  We can thus treat $h_x$ as parameters and take derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_(x)} = h(x) - y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can interpret residuals as negative gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "y & = h_0(x) + h_1(x)\\\\\n",
    "& = h_0(x) + (y - h_0(x)) \\\\\n",
    "& = h_0(x) - (h_0(x) - y) \\\\\n",
    "& = h_0(x) - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_0(x)}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So in fact, we are using \"gradient\" descent in \"gradient\" boosting to find the new model, written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_1(x) = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_0(x)} = y - h_0(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or more generally\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_s(x) = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_{s-1}(x)} = y - h_{s-1}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is the index of predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "**So residuals or gradients?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they are equivalent in the mse loss function, it is more useful to use negative gradients as it is more general, and can apply to other loss functions as well, e.g., **cross-entropy** in the case of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cross entropy, the loss function is\n",
    "\n",
    " $$J= y \\lg h(x) + (1 - y) \\lg (1-h(x))$$\n",
    " \n",
    "If you look at our previous lecture on logistic regression, the derivative of this **in respect to h(x)** will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_(x)} = h(x) - y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This may look the same as mse, but note that our $h(x)$ (i.e., regression tree) outputs continuous values.  In order to transform $h(x)$ into discrete class, we shall transform using sigmoid function $g$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(h(x)) = g(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiclass classification, $g$ is defined as the softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(h(x)) = g(z) = \\frac{e^z_c}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{k} e^z_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remind that to use softmax function, we need to first one-hot encode our y.  And during prediction, we need to perform <code>np.argmax</code> along the axis=1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding learning rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure adding the subsequent predictor would not overfit our model, we shall add an learning rate $\\alpha$ in front of this, which shall be the same across all predictors (different from AdaBoost where alpha is different across all predictors)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_s(x) = - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial h_{s-1}(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What about next predictor**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can stop if we are happy, either using some predefined iterations, or whether the residual does not decrease further using some validation set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is obvious that 2 predictors are simply not enough.  Thus, we first need to calculate the residuals which are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ residual_1 =  y - (h_0(x) + \\alpha h_1(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we define $h_2(x)$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_2(x) = \\alpha(y - (h_0(x) + \\alpha h_1(x)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prediction shall use the following hypothesis function $H(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(x) = h_0(x) + \\alpha_1h_1(x) + \\cdots + \\alpha_sh_s(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the model as simply mean or some constant\n",
    "2. Predict and calculate the residual\n",
    "3. Let the next model fit the residual\n",
    "4. Predict using the combined models and calculate the residual\n",
    "5. Let the next model fit this residual\n",
    "6. Simply repeat 4-5 until stopping criteria is reached"
